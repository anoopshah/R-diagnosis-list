Description: Functions and methods for manipulating 'SNOMED CT' concepts.
    The package contains functions for loading the 'SNOMED CT' release into
    a convenient R environment, selecting 'SNOMED CT' concepts using regular
    expressions, and navigating the 'SNOMED CT' ontology. It provides the
    'SNOMEDconcept' S3 class for a vector of 'SNOMED CT' concepts (stored
    as 64-bit integers) and the 'SNOMEDcodelist' S3 class for a table
    of concepts IDs with descriptions. For more information about 'SNOMED CT'
    visit <https://www.snomed.org/>.
